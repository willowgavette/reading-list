# reading-list
A small reading list app that allows users to enter books they'd like to read along with some information about the books. 
Future updates will integrate API calls from sites like Wikipedia and Amazon in order to gain more information about a book.
When the app works well enough, I'm planning on writing unit tests for it.
After that, I'll likely be porting it to Django to get practice with it.

This is mostly for me to practice and hopefully have something to show a potential employer further down the line.
